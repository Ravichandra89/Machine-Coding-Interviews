    - Add new Task
    - Mark Task as completed
    - Delete Task as completed
    - Filter Tasks  - completed/Pending
    - Presist into localStora - Optional

1. Input of form taken : 
    id : 
    name: "task_name"
    completed: false

Solution: 
    - Pages : 
        - Task Input Form Page: useState setNewTask
        - Task List: Show all Tasks

    - components:
        - TaskCard : showing task name, completed_status, Delete and update task button

    - Delete and update managing through the useReducer for more good state management
